## Langchain Caption Generator
Welcome to the Caption Generator application! This tool is designed to help you create engaging and relevant captions for your images effortlessly. Whether you're a social media manager, a content creator, or just someone looking to add a creative touch to your photos, our Caption Generator has got you covered.

For the Caption Generator, I have used open source LLM model known as Meta's Llama 3.1 in 8 Billion parameters size, Langchain and StreamLit to create UI. 

To use this, you need to install Ollama on your computer. After that using the below command:
              
    ollama pull llama3.1

Afterwards, you need to install two libraries:

    pip install langchain-community
    pip install streamlit

After pulling the repository, run this command

    streamlit run main.py
